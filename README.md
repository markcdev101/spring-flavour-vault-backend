# Flavor Vault Backend 

## Overview

The **Flavor Vault Backend** is a microservice responsible for managing the backend operations of the **Flavor Vault Recipe Management System**. This system allows users to manage recipes, plan meals, and store recipe images efficiently. The backend is built using Spring Boot and provides RESTful APIs for interacting with the system. The backend also handles authentication, authorization, caching, and database management.

## Features

- Recipe management (CRUD operations for recipes)
- Ingredient management
- Meal planning functionality
- JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization
- Caching using Redis for fast recipe retrieval
- MySQL for relational data storage
- MongoDB for image storage (NoSQL)
- Centralized logging using the ELK stack

## Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot** - Java-based framework for building microservices
- **MySQL** - Relational database for storing recipes and ingredients
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for storing recipe images
- **Redis** - Caching for fast data retrieval
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - Authentication and authorization
- **Docker** - Containerized application for easy setup and deployment

- **src/main/java/com/flavorvault/**: Contains the Spring Boot source code (controllers, services, repositories, and models).
- **src/main/resources/**: Contains the `application.properties` for configuring the backend.
- **docker/**: Contains the Docker configuration files including `docker-compose.yml`.
- **pom.xml**: Maven build file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven** (for building the project)
- **Docker** (for containerizing MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flavor-vault-backend.git
   cd flavor-vault-backend
   ```

2. **Set Up Docker Services**:
   - MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis services are configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - To start these services, run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

3. **Configure the Application**:
   - Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and ensure the database connection settings for MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis are correct.

   Example configuration for **MySQL**:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

4. **Build the Project**:
   - Use Maven to build the project:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   - After building, you can run the Spring Boot application:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

6. **Access the APIs**:
   - The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`. You can test the REST API endpoints using tools like **Postman** or **cURL**.

## API Documentation

The REST API allows you to manage recipes, ingredients, and meal plans. A detailed API documentation will be available once the API is built and integrated with Swagger.

## Running Tests

To run unit and integration tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

## Docker Usage

To manage Docker services (MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis), you can use the following commands:

- **Start Services**:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- **Stop Services**:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Check Running Containers**:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
